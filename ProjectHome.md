### Why Develop Widgets for WidgetFX? ###

The biggest setback for user interface design in the history of modern computing was the marketing push for thin-client, web-based UIs.  The whole software industry has been shackled by browser incompatibilities, Javascript limitations, and a document-centric model for web applications.  It has taken a decade of engineering and framework design in HTML and Javascript to match what desktop client technology could easily do in the 80s.

WidgetFX takes advantage of Sun's JavaFX client technology to create stunning user interfaces in a fraction of the time you would spend with traditional web technologies, while providing simple one-click deployment and powerful desktop integration.  If you can dream of an application or design, WidgetFX makes it easy and enjoyable to develop.

How WidgetFX compares to other widget containers:
  * **Open-Source** - WidgetFX is a 100% open-source widget container (widgets themselves can be licensed commercially)
  * **Cross-platform Support** - There are a plethora of widget frameworks, but they are all incompatible, and none of them are truly cross-platform.  WidgetFX runs on all major platforms including Windows XP/Vista, Linux, and Mac OS X.
  * **Robust Security Model** - The migration of web technologies to widgets has left gaping security holes, which is a problem all Javascript based widget frameworks share.  In contrast, WidgetFX has a robust security model that leverages the secure sandbox of the Java platform. (planned for 0.2 release)
  * **Rich Desktop Applications** - Most widget containers are porting legacy web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript back to the desktop, which doesn't allow them to take advantage of Rich Internet Application (RIA) functionality.  In contrast, WidgetFX is designed to be on the front-end of a Rich Desktop Application (RDA) movement by providing a very rich library of visual, animation, and media capabilities.

How WidgetFX differs from existing Java deployment options (Applets/Web Start):
  * **Low-memory Footprint** - Within a browser applets can share a single VM, but once they are dragged to the desktop to be "web-startified" they lose this capability.  For a large number of widgets, this will quickly add up to a large footprint both in memory and JVM startup time.
  * **Open on Startup** - Widget containers both startup automatically on boot and also start any widgets that were open on close.  While you could add hooks to a web-start application to do this for a single application, it is not as seamless as having the user "expect" your widget to be there on start-up.
  * **Widget Mindshare** - Widgets are becoming mainstream, and while they may be comparable to desktop applications, Java will not be perceived as being a player in this space without having a viable offering.  Perhaps the biggest jab on this one came from the w3c in their Widget Landscape report:
    * "3.2 Differences from Java Applets ... It is argued that the most notable difference between them is that widgets are easier for authors to create than Java applets. ... Applets are intended to run inside Web pages, while widgets as described in this document generally serve the purpose of stand-alone applications that run outside of a Web browser."
    * WidgetFX directly addresses these issues through the JavaFX Script language, which simplifies authoring of widgets, and desktop integration features which set WidgetFX widgets apart from standard Java applets
